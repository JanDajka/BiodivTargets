# BiodivTargets
Repository for paper "Urgent need to implement science-based policy targets for marine biodiversity" - Global policy targets effectively address marine biodiversity, but they are not being implemented by countries
You can find:
- Tables for Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) analysis - Pre-2020 and Post-2020 in seperate pdf-documents
- R-codes to recreate our figures
- Data in CSV-files for that R-code
- Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP) archives for their indicators (https://www.bipindicators.net/)

Please let me know should you require anything else regarding our paper (jan-claas.dajka@hifmb.de), always happy to help and collaborate. 

Thanks,

Jan
